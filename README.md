# graphs-console-app

The project is developed for studying graph theory NP-problems in multigraphs. The current version is calculating the maximal clique using Bron-Kerbosh algorithm and
polynomial approximation usign Tabu search based on greedy algorithm, and a maximum common subgraph problem, solved using the method of calculating the modular product of N graphs,
and then finding its maximal clique, which in fact is a common subgraph of the input N graphs.
